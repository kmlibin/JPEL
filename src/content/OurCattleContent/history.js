  contentZero: `Deeply ingrained in the rugged Scottish Highlands for centuries,
    the Highland Cow underwent a rigorous natural selection process,
    where only the fittest and most adaptable individuals endured the
    harsh conditions to carry forth the breed's legacy. Originally
    classified into two distinct classes, the smaller black Kyloe and
    the larger red or black Highlander, these strains now amalgamate
    into a single recognized breed known as Highland.`,
  contentOne: ` In the 18th-century Scottish economy, these cattle played a
    pivotal role, with thousands traversing the country's landscapes
    for markets like Falkirk and Crieff. Queen Victoria's preference
    for the red-colored cattle led to selective breeding, influencing
    their predominant hue today.`,
  contentTwo: ` Highland Cattle exhibit remarkable versatility in
    agricultural practices, excelling in harsh climates and
    contributing not only to premium beef but also to milk production
    and cross-breeding initiatives. Their distinctive double coat, featuring a long, coarse outer
    layer and a soft wooly undercoat, serves as natural insulation,
    reducing the necessity for shelter and emphasizing their enduring
    resilience. Beyond their physical characteristics, Highland Cattle
    are integral to light grazing practices, promoting environmental
    sustainability and garnering international recognition for their
    adaptability. The slow maturation of Highland cattle contributes
    to meat that is tender, flavorful, and succulent. In a study
    conducted at the Manyberries Research Station in Canada, Highland
    beef surpassed other breeds in terms of tenderness and taste.
    Comparisons with Hereford cattle revealed that the Highland group
    produced 2000 pounds more beef, while Highland/Hereford crosses
    outperformed purebred Herefords by 6000 pounds.`,
  contentThree: `The breed's global significance extends beyond its historical
  roots.With a robust population of over 40,000 reported worldwide, Highland
    cattle have become a symbol of adaptability and resilience.  `,
  contentFour: `They thrive in diverse climates and landscapes, from the cold winters of
    Norway to the sweeping pastures of Canada. Revered for their exceptional beef quality, lean meat, and unique grazing abilities,
    Highland cattle continue to play a significant role in agricultural
    practices globally. As they graze and thrive in various
    environments, these "Hairy Coos" have not only preserved their rich
    Scottish heritage but have also become valued contributors to
    sustainable agriculture and effective range management worldwide`,
  factOne: ` With archaeological evidence dating back to the 6th century and
    written records from the 12th century, the Highland Cow (affectionately known in Scotland
    as the "Hairy Coo") has played a large role in Scottish history`,
  factTwo: `Highland beef is renowned for its lower fat and cholesterol
    content compared to other beef breeds, even surpassing chicken
    in certain aspects. The meat's fine texture, succulent flavor,
    and high protein content make it a premium choice in the
    culinary world`,
